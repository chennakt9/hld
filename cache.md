### Write back policy:
- Caching strategy where data is written to the cache first and then written to main memory later

### Write through Policy
- Data is written to both the cache and the main memory simultaneously on every update.

### Write around
- Skip the cache and write directly to memory â€” avoids polluting cache with write-only data
