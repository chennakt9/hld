### CAP and PACLEC

**CAP**
- When there is a network partition, we can choose either Availability or Consistency, but not both

**PACLEC**
- When there is a network partition, we can choose either Availability or Consistency, but not both
- Else we can choose between latency and consistency

### Bloom filter
- A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient, probabilistic data structure that tells you if an element might be in a set or definitely is not

### Blob storage
- Blob Storage is used to store unstructured data like images or videos in the cloud

### Consistent Hashing
- Consistent Hashing is a distributed hashing technique where keys and servers (or nodes) are mapped to a circular hash ring. Each key is assigned to the next server in the clockwise direction. When servers are added or removed, only a small subset of keys need to be remapped, ensuring minimal disruption and better scalability.
